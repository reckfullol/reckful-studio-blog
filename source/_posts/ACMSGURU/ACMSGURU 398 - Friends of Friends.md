# Friends of Friends

<!--more-->

## Problem Description

Social networks are very popular now. They use different types of relationships to organize individual users in a network. In this problem friendship is used as a method to connect users. For each user you are given the list of his friends. Consider friendship as a symmetric relation, so if user a is a friend of user b then b is a friend of a.

A friend of a friend for a is such a user c that c is not a friend of a, but there is such b that b is a friend of a and c is a friend of b. Obviously c ≠ a.

Your task is to find the list of friends of friends for the given user x.

## Input

The first line of the input contains integer numbers N and x (1 ≤ N ≤ 50, 1 ≤ x ≤ N), where N is the total number of users and x is user to be processed. Users in the input are specified by their numbers, integers between 1 and N inclusive. The following N lines describe friends list of each user. The i-th line contains integer di (0 ≤ di ≤ 50) — number of friends of the i-th user. After it there are di distinct integers between 1 and N — friends of the i-th user. The list doesn't contain i. It is guaranteed that if user a is a friend of user b then b is a friend of a.

## Output

You should output the number of friends of friends of x in the first line. Second line should contain friends of friends of x printed in the increasing order.

## Example(s)

|sample input|sample output|
|-|-|
|4 2<br>1 2<br>2 1 3<br>2 4 2<br>1 3|1<br>4|

|sample input|sample output|
|-|-|
|4 1<br>3 4 3 2<br>3 1 3 4<br>3 1 2 4<br>3 1 2 3|0|

## Solution

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);

    int n, x;
    std::cin >> n >> x;
    std::vector<std::set<int>> friends(n + 1, std::set<int>{});

    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int num;
        std::cin >> num;
        while(num--) {
            int j;
            std::cin >> j;
            friends[i].insert(j);
        }
    }

    std::vector<int> res{};
    for(const auto& index : friends[x]) {
        for(const auto& second_index : friends[index]) {
            if(second_index != x && friends[x].find(second_index) == friends[x].end()) {
                res.push_back(second_index);
            }
        }
    }

    std::sort(res.begin(), res.end());
    res.erase(std::unique(res.begin(), res.end()), res.end());

    std::cout << res.size() << std::endl;
    for(const auto& num : res) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
